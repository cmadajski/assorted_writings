# Thoughts on Fermentation for Human Nourishment

## Why Is Fermentation Necessary At All?

Fermentation is certainly not necessary for human existence, but it
does solve a few food-related problems in a very accessible and 
energy-efficient way. A non-comprehensive list of fermentation 
uses includes:

- increasing the availability of certain nutrients in food
- increasing the amount of time a given food is edible without the
use of refrigeration
- increasing the microbial diversity of the human intestinal
environment
- producing novel chemical compounds, some of which have positive
impacts on human function

## How Does Fermentation Work?

Fermentation is the process of using microbial organisms to process
a food product into a new state that is beneficial for human 
consumption. Fermentation is most typically used for processing 
plant material, but can also be used on animal products in 
special circumstances. For the purposes of this document, only 
plant fermentation will be discussed.

## The Practical Aspects of Fermentation

The most important factors to consider during vegetable fermentation
are:

- maintaining an anaerobic environment (minimize oxygen)
- using the right amount of salt for the brine
- limiting exposure to UV light sources
- maintaining a desireable ambient temperature (60-75 degrees)

### Maintaining an Anaerobic Environment

To maintain an anaerobic environment, all vegetable material
must be kept below the water line in whatever container is
being used. There are many ways to accomplish this, but the
easiest methods are:

- glass weights (perfect for mason jars)
- plastic bag filled with water

### Proper Salinity

You only need to understand the below equation to get the salinity
just right every time:

```(weightOfVegetables + weightOfWater) * salt% = amountOfSalt```

The general recommendation is to use a brine between 2% and 3% salt.
The weighing process is very easy to do if you have a kitchen scale
that measures weight in grams.

1. Set the tare weight of the scale to an empty container
2. Put the vegetables in the container
3. Pour water over the vegetables in the container
4. Write down the combined weight of the vegetables and water
5. Multiply that weight by 0.02 for 2% or 0.03 for 3% brines
6. The resulting number is the grams of salt you need
