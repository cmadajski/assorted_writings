Dr. Thomas Dykstra talking with John Kempf on the dynamics between 
insects and plants, specifically insect herbivory (insects eating 
plants) and how we can apply this information to agricultural systems.

> THESIS: insects only feed on plants that are considered unfit, 
nutritionally inferior, dead, or dying.

Humans currently operate under the assumption that we are in 
competition with insects for food. This idea is fueled by the 
obsevation that many modern crops experience decreased yields
due to insect infestations. While insects are undoubtedly the
cause of these crop losses, we must understand the context of
these crop plants to explain why insects would even be interested
in them at all.

In general, insects exist in niches that share a common theme:
they consume material that organisms at higher trophic levels 
(higher in the food chain) do not consume.Termites consume 
wood products because practically no other organisms can. 
Dung beetles consume the undigested lignin and byproducts
expelled by higher-order organisms in feces. If these 
insects did not perform their tasks within their niche,
we would have severe excesses in certain materials on
Earth because they would never be processed or processing
would take place over much greater time scales. The key 
point to understand here is that insects are part of the
clean up crew for the biological world.

Switching gears to plants,
