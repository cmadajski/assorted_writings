# Stoicism - Vices and Virtues
## Introduction
We will assume the idea of Stoicism is already known. The uninitiated can get a brief introduction
by glancing at the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism).
Virtues are actions that align an individual with "nature" and assist in the achievement of
[eudaimonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaimonia). The four Stoic virtues are:
- Wisdom
- Temperance
- Courage
- Justice

Vices are actions that are dissonant with "nature" and move an individual further away from
eudaimonia. The four Stoic vices are the opposite of the aforementioned virtues:
- Foolishness
- Intemperance
- Cowardice
- Injustice

Everything else outside of these vices and virtues falls into the "indifferent"
category, and the Stoics suggest that these indifferent actions should not
have any impact on the pursuit of eudaimonia.
