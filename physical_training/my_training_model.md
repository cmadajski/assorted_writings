# Christian Madajski's Training Model

## Training Overview
My training model encompasses three main elements:
- training skills that make sense given human body structure
- incorporating moderate levels of volatility into most training
- incorporating problem solving into all training

Things that other humans prioritize that I have chosen not to
worry about directly:
- aesthetic considerations
- what training styles are in fashion
- being part of an already established community
- maximizing a single skill at the expense of others

Most of the training priorities shown here are derived from a particular philosophical viewpoint that I find suits my natural biases. They are by no means objective, but they at least have a logical basis. As an introvert, I think I immediately discount the social element of training and that's why it is not included in the priority list (possibly to my detriment). I also have a tendency to prefer the traditional aspects of humanity over the emerging aspects of humanity, which is probably due to the influence of Nassim Taleb (the idea that most new things perish in the face of volatility, while surviving things are more likely to keep surviving). I also base my rationale on what I would consider a more "objective" nature that is largely disconnected from the social constructions that we currently live within. This could be an error, since I'm actively avoiding tactics that are technically viable as long as we continue to exist in the social constructions. However, my disdain for "the matrix" transcends any logical argument so I continue to avoid that line of thinking at all costs.

## A Quick Description of the Three Elements

### Training Based on Human Body Structure
It would seem rational to say that dogs move like they do
because of how they are structured. If a dog were to have
three legs instead of four, then its movement patterns
would have to change slightly in order to accomplish similar
goals to its normal counterparts. A dog with two legs would
have to radically change its movement patterns. This trend
seems to hold for all organisms, including humans. Therefore,
we can say with relative confidence that there are ways that
normal humans "should" move, using patterns that are
complimentary to the human structure and function.

How do we know what we are built to do? Well, through
experimentation we can discover quite quickly what patterns
fit our structure. A non-exhaustive list of these patterns
include:
- walking/running/sprinting
- climbing/swinging
- lifting/carrying/throwing
- striking/grappling

Through learning from others and experimentation, there are
fairly standard ways to accomplish all of the above. We can
most certainly do activities outside of these, but those
"foreign" activities are most likely not well suited given
our structure.

### Training with Volatility
Volatility can be thought of as any elements of an activity that
deviate from what you are used to. Slipping on a piece of ice in
the middle of the sidewalk, running into a new employee at work, 
or squatting with a wider than normal foot stance are all 
examples of volatility. The role of volatility in modern training
has been massively diminished, and I posit that this lack of 
volatility is partially responsible for the increase in injury
rates amongst most athletes today. Especially in sports that 
are highly dynamic and open to creative movement, being unable
to cope with sudden, unusual changes in the environment (or
yourself) is a recipe for destroying tissues.

This is why some degree of volatility should be added to training
on a regular basis. This can be accomplished by taking whatever
skills you are working on and adding small adjustments that you 
could realistically encounter during the activity. If we use 
squatting as an example, you could:
- narrow/widen your stance
- try a unilateral/split stance
- replace the barbell with kettlebells/sandbag/dumbbells/etc
- pauses at half depth/full depth
- small plates under your heels/toes
- add squatting to a circuit with other movements
- allowing knees to track outward (varus) or inward (valgus)

By adding elements that are not typically exposed to, you can
buffer your body against sudden, unexpected changes in the
environment. Exposing oneself to volatility is an insurance
policy against the inevitable volatility we experience in
real life. If you regularly deal with volatility in training,
then you become near-unstoppable in real life. Typical scenarios
that would injure others have no effect on you.

There are also hypertrophy/strength benefits from using volatility to diversify motor unit recruitment, but that topic should be explored separately in another document.

### Problem Solving During Training

Blindly following a set program requires little mental effort in most cases. This is a huge missed opportunity for increasing mental capacity as well as integrating the physical and mental aspects of the human organism. A vast majority of organisms only have movement as a method of acquiring the energy needed to continue existing. If movement was not required, then we could all just become like coral and passively acquire energy from our environment.

Taking a problem-solving approach to training makes training more fun and engaging, especially for those with high openness and ADHD tendencies. Problem solving is also essential for thriving in volatile environments. Considering the trajectory of the world, problem solving is something that should be cultivated in all aspects of life in order to prepare for harsh times. Physical training is a great area in which to develop and express critical thinking, especially since training the body and mind concurrently is the most efficient path for growth.

## It's All Subjective

At the risk of sounding like a hyperliberal nutjob, all of training is subjective. Especially in the modern era, humans don't _need_ to do much of anything in order to acquire energy, security, and socialization. Anything you choose is based on subjective preference and has very little impact on the more sensitive areas of your life. That being said, our bodies do have proclivities based on our evolutionary heritage and we ignore those proclivities at our own peril. We can become super-flexible enlightened yogis or jacked protein-huffing bear-men, but ultimately all those archetypes are disconnected from "reality". We mostly live in a miasma of social constructs, and I wonder how long we can stay in that realm before reality comes crashing back into existence. Maybe we stay here forever. All I know is that if reality returns with a vengeance, leveraging volatility, critical thinking, and human movement is a good insurance policy for not going extinct. Or at the very least, if we are going to go extinct anyways, then I want to put up a good fight.
