# Christian Madajski's Training Model

## Training Overview
My training model encompasses three main elements:
- training skills that make sense given human body structure
- incorporating moderate levels of volatility into most training
- incorporating problem solving into all training

Things that other humans prioritize that I have chosen not to
worry about:
- aesthetic considerations
- what training styles are in fashion
- being part of an already established community
- maximizing a single skill at the expense of others

## A Quick Description of the Three Elements
### Training Based on Human Body Structure
It would seem rational to say that dogs move like they do
because of how they are structured. If a dog were to have
three legs instead of four, then its movement patterns
would have to change slightly in order to accomplish similar
goals to its normal counterparts. A dog with two legs would
have to radically change its movement patterns. This trend
seems to hold for all organisms, including humans. Therefore,
we can say with relative confidence that there are ways that
normal humans "should" move, using patterns that are
complimentary to the human structure and function.

How do we know what we are built to do? Well, through
experimentation we can discover quite quickly what patterns
fit our structure. A non-exhaustive list of these patterns
include:
- walking/running/sprinting
- climbing/swinging
- lifting/carrying/throwing
- striking/grappling

Through learning from others and experimentation, there are
fairly standard ways to accomplish all of the above. We can
most certainly do activities outside of these, but those
"foreign" activities are most likely not well suited given
our structure.

### Training with Volatility
Volatility can be thought of as any elements of an activity that
deviate from what you are used to. Slipping on a piece of ice in
the middle of the sidewalk, running into a new employee at work, 
or squatting with a wider than normal foot stance are all 
examples of volatility. The role of volatility in modern training
has been massively diminished, and I posit that this lack of 
volatility is partially responsible for the increase in injury
rates amongst most athletes today. Especially in sports that 
are highly dynamic and open to creative movement, being unable
to cope with sudden, unusual changes in the environment (or
yourself) is a recipe for destroying tissues.

This is why some degree of volatility should be added to training
on a regular basis. This can be accomplished by taking whatever
skills you are working on and adding small adjustments that you 
could realistically encounter during the activity. If we use 
squatting as an example, you could:
- narrow/widen your stance
- try a unilateral/split stance
- replace the barbell with kettlebells/sandbag/dumbbells/etc
- pauses at half depth/full depth
- small plates under your heels/toes
- add squatting to a circuit with other movements
- allowing knees to track outward (varus) or inward (valgus)

By adding elements that are not typically exposed to, you can
buffer your body against sudden, unexpected changes in the
environment. Exposing oneself to volatility is an insurance
policy against the inevitable volatility we experience in
real life. If you regularly deal with volatility in training,
then you become near-unstoppable in real life. Typical scenarios
that would injure others have no effect on you.

### Training While Problem Solving
