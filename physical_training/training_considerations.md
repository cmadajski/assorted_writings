# Training Considerations for Reasonable Human Development
## Tissue Adaptation Times
One big consideration that most people don't think about (and is rarely talked about in the primary discourse) is that different types of tissue have different timelines for adaptation. I first came across this idea in Verhkoshansky's _Supertraining_, but has likewise been mentioned by Westside Barbell, Christopher Sommer, and others in this sphere of training. This is also a well-known fact in anatomy and physiology cirlces.

A very general and mostly correct list of adaptation times would look like the following:
* short - muscle (24-72 hours)
* medium - nervous system (up to a week)
* long - tendon/ligament (months)
* very long - bones/cartilage (years)

The differing adaptation times between tissues has huge implications for program design. Different applications of force have differing impacts on the tissues involved.

## Exploring Articular Space

This topic might seem to be in direct opposition to the previous topic (specificity), and to a certain degree it is. However, it is important to talk about articular space because it brings us to a very important trade off in the training world. Articular space is a phrase describing all of the possible positions a joint can achieve through movement. Babies are a great example of what ideal articular space looks like for all joints. Typically, as we get older, our habits tend to result in a decrease in articular space. This is not a _necessary_ outcome of age, but rather a consequence of disuse that is especially prevalent in modern times.
