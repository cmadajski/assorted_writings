# Effects of Patternization on Human Tissues

_A majority of the ideas presented here were taken from Dr. Andreo Spina's YouTube channel, specifically [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqBCom9QE6k)._

## On the Ambiguity of Tissues
Humans really like to differentiate and define things. Unfortunately, a vast majority of nature has an element of continuity to it which makes defining things really tricky. A key example of this is what people think of as "muscle". We think a bicep is this fleshy object attached to our arms. You can see it, you can touch it, you can train it to make it bigger or stronger. But if you really look closely at it, the "muscle" really starts to look fuzzy. Muscles taper down to a much smaller size at each end where they gradually transition to tendon. Defining where the muscle starts and ends is strange. This weirdness continues as the tendon transitions into the bone in a similar fashion. When you step back and look at it, everything seems to flow seamlessly from one end to the other.

## How Muscle Actually Works

We know from decades of research that the smallest unit of muscular activation is the motor unit. A motor unit is a motor neuron and all the muscle cells connected to it. Typically speaking, for humans we can assume that most motor neurons are only connected to 2-4 muscle fibers. When the motor neuron gets a signal, it acts like a digital system: it activates at either 100% capacity or 0% capacity(often called the [all-or-none principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-or-none_law)).

If motor units are always 100% or 0%, then how do we have fine motor control?

A single muscle might have thousands of motor units, which fire based on a very complicated algorithm that we don't currently understand. It seems as though our brains work like machine learning algorithms: it determines how much force is needed and activates progressively more motor units until the force need is satisfied. Small changes in joint angles, speed of execution, or sequences of muscle action dynamically change which motor neurons are activated. If an action is performed exactly the same every time, then the variability of motor unit activation decreases drastically. This has important implications for later discussion.

## The Modern Problem

There was a brief period of time where science thought all human movement was stored in the brain as a static program. Doing a bicep curl would activate the "bicep curl" program in the brain. As a result of this thinking, we designed workout programs that focused on exact execution of patterns to get desired results. As we learned in the prior section, movements performed exactly the same way are more likely to activate the same motor units in a similar sequence. There are a few problems with this approach:

* for bodybuilders, training one pattern means there are certain muscle fibers not being trained and hypertrophy is being left on the table. No amount of increasing intensity or increasing reps will allow for more size unless new variations are introduced to stimulate new motor units.
* for humans in general, training one pattern means that certain fibers are not adequately prepared for use in daily life. This means that when a person encounters volatility (something out of the ordinary), then the risk of injury drastically increases. An extreme example of this would be a person who deadlifts 500 pounds with no problems, but ends up throwing their back out bending over to pick up a child. When the positioning changes, new motor unit sequences are used and any unprepared tissues are likely to get damaged or broken.
* for cross-trainers, training a pattern with the hopes of improving another unrelated pattern is a gamble. Very small changes in a movement change motor unit recruitment patterns, so thinking that heavy deadlifts will make you a faster sprinter because it "works" your hamstrings is a mostly silly notion. There might be some carryover, but your better off just doing the movement that you want to accomplish with small variations.

## The Big Insight

People who are familiar with Westside principles know that there are 3 basic approaches to strength training:

* **max effort method**: as heavy as possible
* **dynamic effort method**: as fast as possible
* **repetition method**: as many reps as possible

These make intuitive sense when applied to weight training, but most people don't realize they can likewise be applied to *any* style of training.
