Outline:

- the current fitness landscape
	> driven by money first principles
	> systems leverage uniqueness to gain attention/circus tricks
	> traditional sports are arbitrary/legacy
	> no one considers scientific elements
- start from the basics/bottom up
	> why do we do anything?
	> individuality is real
	> what do you care about?
	> lack of knowledge leads to exploration
- know your group/scene
	> based on your values, find those who are on that path
	> your path is probably pretty narrow
- scientific foundations
	> SAID: you become exactly what you do
	> steady state: do something continuously at a given level
	> accomodation: change stops eventually
	> escalation: periodically change parameters
	> volatility: be ready for unexpected circumstances
	> understand tissue responses (muscle, tendon, neural, etc)
- the issue of dose
	> sport make it easy/limit variables
	> real life is messy/prepare for the worst
	> dose is dynamic, but less dynamic for sport
	> always remember what you need
